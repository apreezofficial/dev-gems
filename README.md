## API Documentation

### Base URL

`http://api.example.com`

### Endpoints

#### POST /api/v1/auth/register

Handles various stages of user registration. The specific action is determined by the `action` field in the request payload.

**Request (action: `send_code`)**:
Sends a verification code to the provided email.
```json
{
  "action": "send_code",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

**Response (Success)**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "verification code sent"
}
```

**Errors**:
- `409 Conflict`: `{"status": "error", "message": "email already exists"}`
- `500 Internal Server Error`: `{"status": "error", "message": "failed to send email"}`

---

**Request (action: `verify_code`)**:
Verifies the provided code against the one sent to the user's email.
```json
{
  "action": "verify_code",
  "code": "123456"
}
```

**Response (Success)**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "code verified, continue registration"
}
```

**Errors**:
- `400 Bad Request`: `{"status": "error", "message": "wrong code"}`

---

**Request (action: `finalize_registration`)**:
Finalizes the user registration by setting the password and optional profile details. Requires prior successful code verification.
```json
{
  "action": "finalize_registration",
  "password": "StrongPassword123",
  "profile_image": "<multipart/form-data-file>", 
  "bio": "A short bio about the user (optional)"
}
```

**Response (Success)**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "registration completed"
}
```

**Errors**:
- `403 Forbidden`: `{"status": "error", "message": "code verification required"}`
- `500 Internal Server Error`: `{"status": "error", "message": "database error saving user details"}`

---

**General Errors for `/api/v1/auth/register`**:
- `400 Bad Request`: `{"status": "error", "message": "invalid action"}` (if `action` is missing or unknown)

## Usage

This project is structured with a `server` directory containing the PHP backend logic and a `client` directory for the frontend.

To interact with the backend:

1.  **Database Initialization**: The `server/query/query.php` script is used to set up the `users` table in your database. You would typically run this script once during deployment or local setup.
    ```bash
    # Assuming your web server serves from the project root
    php server/query/query.php
    ```
2.  **API Interaction**: The `server/auth/register.php` file handles user registration. You can interact with this endpoint using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or client-side JavaScript.

    **Example (Client-Side Fetch API - conceptual for sending a verification code):**

    ```javascript
    const backendApiUrl = 'http://api.example.com'; // Replace with your actual backend URL

    async function sendVerificationCode(username, email) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${backendApiUrl}/server/auth/register.php`, {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    action: 'send_code',
                    username: username,
                    email: email
                }),
            });

            const data = await response.json();
            if (response.ok) {
                console.log('Success:', data.message);
            } else {
                console.error('Error:', data.message);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Network error:', error);
        }
    }

    // Example call
    // sendVerificationCode('JaneDoe', 'jane.doe@example.com');
    ```

    The `client/index.php` and `client/includes/` folders contain a simple PHP-based frontend that uses Tailwind CSS for styling and basic JavaScript for interactivity (like theme toggling and a scroll-to-top button). This client part would typically make calls to the backend API for functionalities like user registration and login, although the provided code only shows the aesthetic and some client-side interactions.

    **Frontend Structure Overview:**

    *   `client/index.php`: The main landing page, showcasing features, pricing, testimonials, and FAQs.
    *   `client/tailwind.js`: Local Tailwind CSS build for styling.
    *   `client/includes/nav.php`: Navigation bar component.
    *   `client/includes/footer.php`: Footer component.

    The project is designed to be a starting point for a full-stack video conferencing application.
