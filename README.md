## Usage

This project is a static landing page built with PHP includes for modularity. To view and interact with the page:

1.  **Open `client/index.php` in a web browser.**
    Since it uses PHP includes, you'll need a local web server (like Apache, Nginx, or PHP's built-in server) to render the PHP files correctly.
    
    Example using PHP's built-in server from the project root:
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000 -t client/
    ```
    Then, open `http://localhost:8000/index.php` in your browser.

2.  **Navigate the Page**:
    *   Use the navigation bar at the top to jump to sections like "Features," "Pricing," and "About."
    *   Click the "Get Started" or "Learn More" buttons in the hero section to explore the page.

3.  **Toggle Theme**:
    *   Click the sun/moon icon in the navigation bar (both desktop and mobile) to switch between light and dark themes. Your preference will be saved in local storage.

4.  **Interact with FAQs**:
    *   In the "Frequently Asked Questions" section, click on any question to expand or collapse its answer.

5.  **Scroll to Top**:
    *   As you scroll down the page, a "Scroll to Top" button will appear in the bottom-right corner. Click it to smoothly return to the top of the page.
